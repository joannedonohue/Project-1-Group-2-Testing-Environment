## Hypothesis

The shift towards remote work is changing commercial real estate markets in major U.S. cities by accelerating the decline  of traditional office buildings and need for daily commuting. 

Remote work could mean vacant office spaces:
As more people work from home, companies will need less office space. 
With vacancies on the rise, landlords could be forced to lower rent to attract tenants.
   
   2.  Individual cities and varying outcomes: 
 The impact of remote work may vary widely depending on each city's economy,   transportation, and real estate market.

## Methodology

To evaluate our hypothesis, we will look at:

  Commercial Real Estate Trends:
o Office vacancies and pricing: We collected data from CBRE, JLL, and CoStar on office vacancy rates and prices in twenty-five major U.S. cities from 2015 to 2024.

Digging deeper: We will analyze the data carefully to understand how strong the relationship is between remote work and commercial real estate. We will consider other factors like local economies, the rise of remote work since the Coronavirus pandemic, and commercial real estate. 
The big picture: What other things could influence our results? Things like population changes, the number of office buildings, the pandemic, and overall economic conditions.

    2.  The Shift to Remote Work:
Changing commute patterns: We will analyze U.S. Census data to see if people are commuting less often or for shorter distances, which could signal an increase in remote work.
Declining public transit use: We will examine Federal Transit Administration data to determine if fewer people are relying on public transportation, another potential indicator of remote work adoption.

Drawing Conclusions:
In Summary: Our findings will show whether remote work is affecting office vacancies and prices, is impacting and highlight key trends and differences between cities.

## Conclusions

Although prices are stagnant, they have not come down as quickly as vacancy rates have increased
This may be due to the “extend and pretend” policy among banks to keep the CRE market afloat
Low commuter rates into major metro areas of NYC and SF paint a scary picture for the CRE industry and local business that rely on commuters
